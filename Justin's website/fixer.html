				Scrabble is a great game, but it can be challenging to find people of the same experience level to play with.  If one player has a much larger vocabulary, and is better at spelling, the game may not be much fun.
				<br><br>
				This program contains a series of questions specifically designed to measure your vocabulary size and spelling ability in the context of Scrabble.  The test takes about 10 minutes to complete. 
				<br><br>
				Your score on this test will be used to generate your Scrabble Bonus.  Everyone who wants to play Scrabble together should take this test, and then add their own Scrabble Bonus to their score in Scrabble.  Hopefully, this bonus will compensate for any vocab or spelling differences in the players, and allow Scrabble to be a competitive game of skill for everyone.  Have fun!
